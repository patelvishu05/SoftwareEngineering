# :notes: Spoofify :notes:
 A very awesome Android music streaming app that allows user to stream music from their phone using this app.

## Run the application
1. To run the application wait for all processes to complete after successful cloning.
2. The application can be run using the Green play button ► from the upper left corner.
   (if you have not set up an emulator device, you will need to do so)
3. Please wait until all build processes are successfully completed, and then you 
   should start seeing the app running on emulator.

## Run Issues
> While working on the project towards the end, we had issues running the app on personal
  devices. The app was working for only 1 of our Team Member. Issues may were because of the
  emulator.
  We were able to circumvent this issue by installing Genymotion, an alternate Android Device Emulator.
  Additionally, you will need to install a plugin for Genymotion in Android Studio to use the emulator.
